# Hangman

Classic game of Hangman

## Description

Hangman is a classic guessing game that most of us have played BUT did you know that Though the origins of the game are unknown, a variant is mentioned in a book of children's games assembled by Alice Gomme in 1894 called Birds, Beasts, and Fishes. This version lacks the image of a hanged man, instead relying on keeping score as to the number of attempts it took each player to fill in the blanks.
